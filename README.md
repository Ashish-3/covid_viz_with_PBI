## Hello and welcome to my Power BI visualization project! 

**The goal of  this project is to create a COVID-19 dashboard.** <br>
This is a quick personal project to practice some Power BI querying and visualization skills. 

You can have a quick overview of the Power BI dashboard by checking this pdf file:
